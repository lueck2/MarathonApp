In this package you will find the following three folders:

1) drawable-hdpi
	-> Contains the images used in the .xml file as well as a special "style sheet" 
	   called TextFieldBorder.xml which makes the email and passwords text fields white
	    with rounded corners. 
	   
2) layout
	-> Contains the main .xml file 

3) values
	-> Contains the strings.xml file

All of these belong in the "res" folder. Simply replace your project's drawable-hdpi, layout,
and values folders with these, or simply copy the contents of these folders into their
correct folders in your project.
