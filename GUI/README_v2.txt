GUI Update 2: In this update you will all three folders:

1) drawable-hdpi
	-> Contains all the images from the previous update plus the images for the
	   new homepage. 

2) layout
	-> Contains the .xml file for the homepage ("marthonapp_homepage.xml")
	   as well as the previous main .xml file from the first GUI update

3) values
	-> Contains the strings.xml with all the strings from the original update
	   with the new strings created for the components on the homepage.

Simply replace your current project's drawable-hdpi, layout, and values folders with these
and you should be good to go. You may also just drag the individual files into their 
respective folders on your project.
